# **Offers and Active Email**

This manual is about creating an offer via the offers module and sending this offer as an active email. Customers can click on a lot in this offer to go to the offers page on their webshop.

We start by selecting which debtor we want to make the offer for. Via the 'open/add' button we can indicate for which debtor we want to do this. Please note, the order number must remain empty otherwise the offer will not be visible on the webshop

When a debtor is selected you can start adding the lots. For this we press the 'add' button and choose in which source we want to select the parts. You can use lots from stock and order list in 1 offer

After choosing a source, for example from stock, you first select from which stock you want to select. Then you use the space bar to select the lots that you want to have on offer, when you are done selecting you close the stock or order list screen, you do not have to save anything first.

You will then see the selected lots in the offer overview, where you can also adjust the prices, etc. The price you enter in the price column is the price that the customer will see in the offer and on the webshop. To close this screen press ok, all changes will be saved this way.

Then you can use the example button to show an example of the offer on screen, for that you must first select which layout you want to use. If everything is to your liking, you can use the email webpage button to send the offer, this uses the data set in the debtor.

You can also set a standard layout per debtor, then use the checkbox 'Debtor set layout has priority' in the layout choice when sending.

We have now created an offer for 1 customer, but want to use this offer for other customers as well. For this, we first select the already created offer and press the copy button, this opens the well-known selection screen where we can select the other debtors/debtor groups, etc.
